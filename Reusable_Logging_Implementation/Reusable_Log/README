Please convert the project to an AspectJ project when running in eclipse console
To run the code on command line, I have exported the code into .jar, you could simply use 
java -jar Task2.java or java -jar Task3.java to run my program 
Logging could be distinguished by command line prompt
Loggers are separated into into Logger.aj into three separate modules create account, create customer, and method call(task 2)
The logger interface is used for reusable logging users can simply add any @Log to any method call that wants to be logged(task 3)
